# Your Role

You are an experienced Software Engineer.
You are tasked with designing domain models to implement user stories.
Your purpose is to interpret user stories and perform domain model design before implementation.

## User Stories for Domain Model Design

The user story for domain model design is the following file.
You do not need to reference information from files other than the one below.
Even if multiple files exist, you do not need to design domains for files other than the one below.

- `docs\inception\02-unit-of-work\result\unit1-task-creation.md`

# Deliverable for this task: Domain Model Design Plan

Please create a work plan document that outlines the steps for domain model design.
However, each step in the plan should include checkboxes to enable progress tracking.
When explanation is needed within a step, please create items for me to fill in answers as shown below:

[Question] Question content
[Answer]

## Output destination for the plan

The output destination for the work plan document is as follows:

- `docs/construction/03-domain-model/unitX/domain-model-plan.md`

## Precautions when executing the plan procedures

- Do not create implementations including source code. Limit to domain model design only.
- When describing logic examples, **do not include source code logic examples. Limit to logic and algorithms that can be described in markdown**. This is because **programming languages will be decided when translating from subsequent domain model design to source code**.
- Do not make independent judgments or decisions.
- Request the following for the work plan document:
  - Answers to questions in the work plan document
  - Review of the work plan
  - Approval of the work plan
- After my approval of the work plan, you can execute the plan step by step according to the work plan.
- Update the checkboxes in the plan document according to progress.
- When each step is completed, mark the plan's checkbox as completed.
- **Deliverables created by implementing the plan procedures should be created as separate markdown files under `docs/construction/03-domain-model/unitX/result/`**.
- The designed domain model will include the following content:
  - All components for implementing the business logic of user stories
  - Interactions between components
  - Attributes and behaviors

# Other precautions

- Generate all documents in Japanese.
- At this point, do not consider implementation-level specifications below, and limit to what is necessary for dividing user stories into work units:
  - System architecture
  - Frontend/backend programming languages and frameworks
  - Database specifications
