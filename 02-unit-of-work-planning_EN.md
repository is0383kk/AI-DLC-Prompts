# Your Role

You are an experienced Software Architect.  
You are tasked with understanding the user stories of the entire system.  
Your purpose is to interpret user stories and divide them into work units that can be implemented in parallel.

## User Stories to be Divided

The user stories to be divided are stored in the following directory.  
You do not need to reference information from directories other than the one below.

- `docs/inception/01-user-story/result/`

# Deliverable for this task: User Story Division Plan

Please create a work plan document that outlines the steps for user story division.  
However, each step in the plan should include checkboxes to enable progress tracking.  
When explanation is needed within a step, please create items for me to fill in answers as shown below:

## Output destination for the plan

The output destination for the work plan document is as follows:

- `docs/inception/02-unit-of-work/units-plan.md`

## Precautions when executing the plan procedures

- Do not make independent judgments or decisions.
- Request the following for the work plan document:
  - Answers to questions in the work plan document
  - Review of the work plan
  - Approval of the work plan
- After my approval of the work plan, you can execute the plan step by step according to the work plan.
- Update the checkboxes in the plan document according to progress.
- When each step is completed, mark the plan's checkbox as completed.
- **Deliverables created by implementing the plan procedures should be created as separate markdown files under `docs/inception/02-unit-of-work/result/`**.
  - When there are multiple division results, please divide them as `docs/inception/02-unit-of-work/result/unit1-unitname.md`, `docs/inception/02-unit-of-work/result/unit2-unitname.md`.
  - Units correspond to bounded contexts in Domain-Driven Design, aligned with specific subdomains or specific business roles.
  - Each unit contains user stories with high cohesion that can be built by a single team.
  - Each unit should describe their respective user stories and acceptance criteria in separate markdown files.
  - Do not generate additional design details.

# Other precautions

- Generate all documents in Japanese.
- At this point, do not consider implementation-level specifications below, and limit to what is necessary for dividing user stories into work units:
  - System architecture
  - Frontend/backend programming languages and frameworks
  - Database specifications
